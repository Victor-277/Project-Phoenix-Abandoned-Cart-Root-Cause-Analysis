# Project Phoenix: Abandoned Cart Root Cause Analysis

**Project Analyst:** Victor Ademola  
**Date:** October 2025  

---

## Executive Summary
A **52% cart abandonment rate** was traced not to pricing or “price shock,” but to **Critical Checkout Friction** — unexpected barriers or errors at payment time.

---

## Key Insights
- **Time Factor:** 100% of abandonment occurs within **2 minutes**.  
- **Item Count:** 50% of abandoned carts had just **1–2 low-value items**.  
- **Source:** Social media accounts for **50% of customer visits**.  
- **Discount:** 100% of abandoned carts had **no active discounts**.  

---

## Root Cause
Customers are **not reconsidering purchases** — they are **blocked** by checkout errors, forced registrations, or surprise fees.

---

## Recommendations
- **Ease Payment Flow:** Add local payment options and remove technical barriers.  
- **Price Transparency:** Display shipping costs and fees **upfront**.  
- **Cart Recovery:** Send automated reminders **4 hours** post-abandonment.  
- **Strategic Discounts:** Use targeted events (e.g., weekly **“Black Friday”**) to boost trust and conversion.

## Outcome Goal
Eliminate checkout friction, recover abandoned carts, and convert **25–35% of lost users**.
